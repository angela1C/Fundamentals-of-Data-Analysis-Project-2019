# Fundamentals_Data_Analysis_Project-2019
This is the repository for project for Fundamentals of Data Analysis at GMIT 2019.

This assessment concerns the well-known tips dataset and the Python packages seaborn and jupyter.
The project is broken into three parts, as follows.

1. Description: A git repository containing a jupyter notebook that uses descriptive statistics and plots to describe the tips dataset. (30%). Provide a good summary of the tips dataset.

2. Regression: To the above jupyter notebook add a section that discusses and analyses whether there is a relationship between the total bill and tip amount (30%). A good analysis of the relationship between total bill and tip, with good explanations of the analysis.
 
3. Analyse: Again using the same notebook, analyse the relationship between the variables within the dataset. (40%). Reasonable work investigating the relationship between the variables, with interesting relationships highlighted and discussed.



## How to download this repository

Go to the URL for the repository on GitHub at https://github.com/angela1C/Fundamentals_Data_Analysis_Project-2019
Click the green Clone or download button

## How to run the code

**Python 3** was used to develop this project. Python 3 can be downloaded from the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/. It can also be downloaded using the **Anaconda Python distribution** at https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

However, the Jupyter Notebook [tips-project.ipynb](https://github.com/angela1C/Fundamentals_Data_Analysis_Project-2019/blob/master/tips-project.ipynb) with all it's code and output can be viewed directly in this GitHub repository in the browser without Python 3 installed.

If, however the notebook doesn't render on GitHub as may happen from time to time, the url for this repository https://github.com/angela1C/numpy.random can be copied and pasted into the [Jupyter nbviewer ](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org ) at
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org  where you enter the location of a Jupyter Notebook and click `Go` to have it rendered there.
