# Fundamentals_Data_Analysis_Project-2019
This is the repository for project for Fundamentals of Data Analysis at GMIT 2019.

This assessment concerns the well-known tips dataset and the Python packages seaborn and jupyter.
The project is broken into three parts, as follows.

1. Description: A git repository containing a jupyter notebook that uses descriptive statistics and plots to describe the tips dataset. (30%). Provide a good summary of the tips dataset.

2. Regression: To the above jupyter notebook add a section that discusses and analyses whether there is a relationship between the total bill and tip amount (30%). A good analysis of the relationship between total bill and tip, with good explanations of the analysis.
 
3. Analyse: Again using the same notebook, analyse the relationship between the variables within the dataset. (40%). Reasonable work investigating the relationship between the variables, with interesting relationships highlighted and discussed.
