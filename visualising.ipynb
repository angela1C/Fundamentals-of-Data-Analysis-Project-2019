    "While `pandas` functions were used above to look at a summary statistics of the dataset using statistics, the `seaborn` package will now be used to create some visualisations of the dataset that can be used to verify these summary statistics. `pandas` does have some basic plotting functionality built in from the `matplotlib` package. `seaborn` is built on top of`matplotlib` and closely integrated with `pandas` data structures.\n",
    " \n",
    "Plots can highlight any obvious relationships between the different variables in the dataset. They can also be used to identify any groups of observations that are clearly separate to other groups of observations. There are many different ways to visualise this dataset using the seaborn library and no universal best way. I will look through the examples and documentation on <https://seaborn.pydata.org> and see which ones are most suitable for the tips dataset and learn more about the seaborn plotting functions.\n",

    ">Statistical analysis is a process of understanding how variables in a dataset relate to each other and how those relationships depend on other variables. Visualization can be a core component of this process because, when data are visualized properly, the human visual system can see trends and patterns that indicate a relationship.\n",

    "Seaborn's `relplot()` is a (figure-level) function for visualizing statistical relationships using scatter plots or line plots. These are fairly simple 2 dimensional plots of the data but further dimensions can be added where the hue(colour), size, and style semantics of the points can take on meaning representing further variables in the same plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Showing several semantic variables at the same time on a single plot may not always be suitable, instead multiple plots may be more appropriate for showing the relationship between multiple variables. Instead of using additional variables as semantics they could be used to facet the plots. This is where you make multiple axes and plot subsets of the data on each one. (`FacetGrid`).\n",
